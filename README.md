# MusicPsychologyToolbox

The MusicPsychologyToolbox contains tools to measure human vital functions (breathing and heart rate) together with musical performance parameters like audio, midi and video to make music psychological studies possible.  

* The folder "arduino" contains various sketches for recording the measured values with the Arduino Uno.

* The "scripts" folder contains the script for recording data with a Linux based computer, like RaspberryPi.

* The file "Airflow_Nose_Case.FCStd" can be used to print the housing for the nose sensor.
